## BluJam

Our 48 submission for Blujam 2016 at Victoria University of Wellington

This was our first blujam game, sadly it crashed and burned as a lot of lessons about working in a large team with no team work experiences were gained. 

## About  

This was an attempt at a 48 hour game jam during my first year of university. Sadly it did really not go that well but I managed to extract some valuable lessons from it, predominantly in regards to team work. 

I like to keep this Repo up as a reminder of older projects and contrast them against more recent game-jams.
